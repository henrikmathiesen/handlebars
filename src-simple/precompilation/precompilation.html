    <!--
        - When doing precompilation, we only need handlebars.runtime.min.js and not the full handlebars.min.js
        - We are going to start of with a NPM script, following the official documentation

        NPM Script
        handlebars <input> -f <output> -k each -k if -k unless --knownOnly
        -k means precompile these helpers (more efficient), --knownOnly means that only those helpers are allowed in code

        Note: 
            - templates file extension must be .handlebars (and not .hbs)
            - globs seams to not be supported, not so easy then to seperate partial builds (even though the compiler supports it with -p)
            - if partials were in seperate folders, we could have used this: https://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/03/14/quick-handlebars-tip-concerning-precompilation/
            - this is a solution that works: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12014547/how-do-i-precompile-partials-for-handlebars-js
                - See top of precompilation.js
                - Might not be optimal, I think we need Gulp or Webpack
